# ![RealWorld Example App](go-realworld-logo.png)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrislewispac/realworld-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrislewispac/realworld-starter-kit)

> ### Go codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Go** implemented using the **Gin** framework including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Go** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

# Getting started

> ## Technology Requirements
> I will be assuming you are working on a Mac OSX or other UNIX based system. I cannot provide Windows support at this time.
> ### Installing Go
> First, [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/) from the [Official Website](https://golang.org/dl/) for your specific computer (Mac, Linux)
> Second, follow the [Installation Instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) from the [Official Website](https://golang.org/doc/install).
> ## Vendoring & Dependencies
> We will be using Glide to manage our dependencies until Go's official dependency management is released at which time please make an issue and we will update our repo.


# Test Driven Development

> ## Testing Style
> We will write our tests in a behavioral style using [Go Convey](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey)
> ## Continuous Integration
> I usually use Gitlab and it's associated Continuous Integration and Deployment but since we are on Github we will use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).


# Tutorial Will Hopefully Be Here

> ## I am going to do my best to record video of all of my development and later edit it and narrate it.
